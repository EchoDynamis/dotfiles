# Development Log

## 2025-07-13 14:30:00 - Refactor MediaDisplay.qml for Bar Layout
- Replaced standard `Button` and `Text` with custom `Control` and `ElideText` components.
- Adjusted `RowLayout` to ensure proper horizontal distribution and dynamic resizing of text, pushing buttons to sides.

## 2025-07-13 15:00:00 - Corrected MediaDisplay.qml Component Usage
- Replaced `ElideText` with `StyledText` and `Control` with `StyledRect` and `MaterialIcon` due to component visibility.
- Implemented hover effects for previous/next icons using `parent.hovered`.

## 2025-07-13 15:30:00 - Reverted MediaDisplay.qml to Standard QtQuick Types
- Corrected component usage by reverting to standard `QtQuick.Controls.Button` and `QtQuick.Text`.
- Applied styling and icon hover logic directly to these standard components.
- This addresses the "Type unavailable" errors for `StyledText` and `StyledRect`.

## 2025-07-13 15:45:00 - Refined MediaDisplay.qml Layout Sizing
- Removed `Layout.preferredWidth` and `Layout.preferredHeight` from "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
- This allows the `RowLayout` to dynamically size buttons based on their content and distribute space more effectively.

## 2025-07-13 16:00:00 - Restored Button Visibility and Added Debugging
- Added `implicitWidth` and `implicitHeight` to `Button` elements to ensure visibility.
- Added `onHoveredChanged` debug messages to confirm button interaction.

## 2025-07-13 16:15:00 - Set Fixed Width for Media Info Text
- Set `Layout.preferredWidth: 400` for the `MouseArea` containing the song metadata in `MediaDisplay.qml` to prevent overlap.

## 2025-07-13 16:30:00 - Fixed MediaDisplay.qml Syntax Error
- Removed an extra closing brace `}` at the end of the file, resolving the "Unexpected token `}`" error.
